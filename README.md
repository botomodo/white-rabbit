### Problem

Current Web3 adoption too low because of **developer-oriented infrastructure** 

In our vision, Web3 adoption will come when anybody can launch Web3 project **without code** 

### Product

We aimed to deliver Web3 platform, where customers could launch own dApp in 1 hour without code.

All what they need to do it’s make 3 steps:

Connect wallet - connect wallet to get private key and govern dApp, because White Rabbit is non-custodial;

Choose Business model - choose use case for future dApp, White Rabbit delivers different use cases for Gated Access and Marketplace in our MVP;

Customize template - customize design and identic for your future dApp.


### Tech principles


We make sure, that for wide Web3 adoption we should follow next principles in our actions:
