### Problem

Currently, Web3 adoption is too low because of **developer-oriented infrastructure** 

Our vision is that Web3 adoption will come when anybody is able to launch Web3 project **without code** 

### Product

We aimed to deliver a Web3 platform where customers could launch their own dApp in 1 hour without code.

All you need to do is these 3 steps:

**Connect wallet.** Connect a wallet to get a private key and govern the dApp (White Rabbit is non-custodial);

**Choose Business model.** Choose a use case for your future dApp(We deliver different use cases for Gated Access and Marketplace in our MVP);

**Customize template.** Customize design and identity for your future dApp.


### Tech principles


We believe that for wide Web3 adoption we should follow these principles in our actions:

**Multichain** -  we’ll connect any ecosystem which can be useful

**Open source** - all our code will be published on GitHub

**Freemium** - we don’t charge any fee for launching on our platform

**Non-custodial** - projects are 100% governed by creator wallets after launch


### Audience

Creators and Entrepreneurs are grouped in different market segments which can’t be claimed in the first iteration. We focused two segments in our MVP:



* Patreon bloggers that accept crypto
* Brands which launch NFT promo

### Business model

Business model developed according to our principles:



* White Rabbit doesn’t charge any fee for dApp launching;
* dApp owner pays only infrastructure fee for hosting and transactions;
* dApp owner can buy additional services from Service partners;
* Service partners share revenue with White Rabbit if they sell services through platform;
* White Rabbit is financed by dev grants from infrastructure partners;
